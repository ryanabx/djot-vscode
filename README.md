# Work in progress Djot Visual Studio Code plugin!

[djot](https://github.com/jgm/djot) is a lightweight markup language similar to Markdown, developed by John MacFarlane.

This extension aims to provide complete language features for djot, including:

- [x] Syntax highlighting
- [x] Keybindings

  - Bold: `ctrl + b`
  - Italics: `ctrl + i`
- [x] Export to HTML
- [ ] Live preview

## Contributing

If you like djot and would like to contribute, make a PR! This extension is **heavily** work in progress, so there's a lot of work that needs to be done! The biggest thing would be getting live preview support working. See [this issue](https://github.com/ryanabx/djot-vscode/issues/1) for the details.

## Special Thanks

[Djot-Marker](https://github.com/wisim3000/Djot-Marker/) for the TextMate grammar (provides syntax highlighting)

[Djot.js](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js) for the HTML export (and in the future, preview)
