# Work in progress Djot Visual Studio Code plugin!

[djot](https://github.com/jgm/djot) is a lightweight markup language similar to Markdown, developed by John MacFarlane.

This extension aims to provide language features for djot, including:

- Syntax highlighting
- Keybindings

  - Bold: `ctrl + b`
  - Italics: `ctrl + i`
- Live preview and export options with [djot.js](https://github.com/jgm/djot.js)

Portions of this extension will be based off Microsoft's Markdown extensions for VSCode:
